//iteration 3: Loops

//3.1 Print all the characters of the driver's name, separated by a space and in capitals i.e. "J O H N"

//3.2 Print all the characters of the navigator's name, in reverse order. i.e. "nhoJ"

//3.3 Depending on the lexicographic order of the strings, print:
//- The driver's name goes first.
//- Yo, the navigator goes first definitely.
//- What?! You both have the same name?
